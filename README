Singleton pattern for GameThread class to avoid more than one instance,
it runs all the games that are played, which are objects of the Game class.

Made the package commands in order to avoid having an abstract "God class",
that stores all the static methods, which would have become hard to manage.
So inside that package there is a class for every static method that is
implemented. We don't need instances of these classes so they are final
with private constructors.
